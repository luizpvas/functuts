Improving SEO for a brand new website
My personal journey to learn about SEO and attempt to improve this website's ranking on Google. Come along for the ride. 

# Improving SEO for a brand new website

I just released this website, and at this moment Google is not aware it exists yet.

I know the very basics of SEO, so this is gonna be interesting. My goals are:

* Make this website appear as the first result when people search for "functuts"
* Make at least some tutorial appear when when people search for the exact title.

I have no idea if this is too little or too much to get done. **Let's get started**.

## Better URLs

Slugs currently start with a number and end with `.md` (for Markdown).

I'm not sure if this hurts SE ranking somehow, but why not remove them since we're here. This is what is looks like now (ignore `localhost`):

## Better `<title>` tags

There is only one `<title>` tag for the whole website, and it reads **FuncTuts.com**. It seems it's better to add a sentence, something like **FuncTuts - Tutorials about Elixir and Elm**.

I also changed the `<title>` for the tutorials so it has the same value as the tutorial's title.
