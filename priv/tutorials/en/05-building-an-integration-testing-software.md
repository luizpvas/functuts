# Building an integration testing software

(( **Work in progress** ))

For the past few days I've been thinking about integration testing. It's personally my least favorite testing strategy to write. It's difficult because we need good HTML attributes, it's slow to run and randomly fails depending on timing issues.

On the other hand, it's the most useful testing strategy there is &mdash; what can be more ensuring the software actually works than testing from the perspective of the end user?
