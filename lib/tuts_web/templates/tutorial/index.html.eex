  <p>I've been interested in <strong>functional programming</strong> for a while now.</p>

  <p>I have played with a lot of languages (Clojure, Haskell, F# and OCaml), but I really enjoyed <strong>Elixir</strong> and <strong>Elm</strong>'s community. They both have great documentation, great forums and great talks on Youtube. This year I was finally able to get my first Elm code in production at <a href="http://aloweb.com.br">Aloweb</a>, and this got me even more excited to share my experience with those languages.</p>
